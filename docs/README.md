# graphql-server

## GraphQL Experiment

This project was built as part of the Innovation Week at my workplace XE.com

I did the server-end built on GraphQL where as my colleague integrated with this API using Apollo Client and React

The server exposes one endpoint that supports multiple queries and a mutation

Check out the code to explore.

**P.S. It was my first ever experience working with GraphQL and I am sure I have just scratched the surface and there is lot more to learn in future.**
